# Accelerating SIVIA (Set Inversion via Interval
Analysis). An Interval Set Membership Technique to
explain Neural Classifier Decisions.

The purpose of this thesis is to propose an alternative, breadth-first, Branch and Bound parallel algorithm to estimate the validation space of Neural Networks, which is a problem that requires exhaustive search of that space.
